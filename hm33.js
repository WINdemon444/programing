// 🚀 TASK: CALCULATE TOTAL PLAYER HEALTH


// 1. Create the first player object named 'player1'.
//   It must have a 'name' property ("Warrior") and a 'health' property (150).
//  2. Create the second player object named 'player2'.
//   It must have a 'name' property ("Mage") and a 'health' property (95).
// 3. Calculate the sum of both players' healths. Store the result in a variable named 'totalHealth'.
// 4. Print the 'totalHealth' value to the console in a clear sentence.
let player1 = {
  name: "Warrior",
  health: 150
}
let player2 = {
  name: "Mage",
  health: 95
}

let totalHealth = player1.health + player2.health;
console.log("The total: " + totalHealth);
