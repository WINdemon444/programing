// "Who Has the Higher Score?"
// Imagine two teams playing a game:

// - Set teamAScore = 45 and teamBScore = 52.
// - Subtract 5 points from Team A’s score.
// - Divide Team B’s score by 2.
// - Write a program to check which team has the higher score.
// - Log "Team A has the higher score" or "Team B has the higher score" based on the comparison.
// !!!! use explaining comments for  each line of code
let teamAScore=45
let teamBScore=52
teamAScore=teamAScore-5
teamBScore=teamBScore/2
if (teamAScore>teamBScore){
    console.log("Team A has the higher score")
}else{
    console.log("Team b has the higher score")
}
