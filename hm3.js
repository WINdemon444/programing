// Step Counter
// Description: Write a program that keeps track of a user's steps for a week. 
//For each day, the user inputs the number of steps they walked.
//  Use the += operator to add each dayâ€™s steps to a variable total_steps. 
//At the end of the week, print the total number of steps walked.

// Example:

// Steps for each day: 5000, 6000, 5500, 7000, 8000, 6500, 5000
// Result: Total steps = 43000
let total_steps=0
total_steps += 5000
total_steps += 6000
total_steps += 5500
total_steps += 7000
total_steps += 8000
total_steps += 6500
total_steps += 5000
console.log("total steps =" ,  total_steps)
